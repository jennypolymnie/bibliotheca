        title: 'Evaluating forensic biology results given source level propositions',
        abstract: 'The evaluation of forensic evidence can occur at any level within the hierarchy of propositions depending on the question being asked and the amount and type of information that is taken into account within the evaluation. Commonly DNA evidence is reported given propositions that deal with the sub-source level in the hierarchy, which deals only with the possibility that a nominated individual is a source of DNA in a trace (or contributor to the DNA in the case of a mixed DNA trace). We explore the use of information obtained from examinations, presumptive and discriminating tests for body fluids, DNA concentrations and some case circumstances within a Bayesian network in order to provide assistance to the Courts that have to consider propositions at source level. We use a scenario in which the presence of blood is of interest as an exemplar and consider how DNA profiling results and the potential for laboratory error can be taken into account. We finish with examples of how the results of these reports could be presented in court using either numerical values or verbal descriptions of the results',

        title: 'Visualising latent DNA on swabs',
        abstract: 'Collection for touch DNA either at scenes or on items submitted to a forensic laboratory is based on assumptions as to where a person made direct contact. In many instances a swab may be applied to an area where no contact has been made. Many swabs may therefore be submitted for DNA profiling on which no DNA is present, resulting in the loss of both time and resources by analysing such swabs. This study has developed a simple, fast, DNA-staining and fluorescence microscopy-based screening method for swabs to indicate if there is any DNA from which to generate a profile. Ten different types of swabs were tested covering the major types used (foam, cotton and nylon). Each swab was treated by: no addition of dye or DNA, addition of dye only, addition of known DNA and addition of dye and DNA. The stain used was DiamondTM Nucleic Acid Dye (DD) and fluorescence microscopy was achieved with a digital microscope equipped with a blue LED light source (480 nm) for excitation and an emission filter of 510 nm. Two types of samples were tested, either buccal swabs or swabs collected from areas touched by volunteers and all analyses were performed in triplicate. The samples were collected and retained at room temperature with time intervals of 0 day, 7 days,14 days, 21 days, and 28 days before detection using DD staining and fluorescence microscopy. Seven of the swab types used were found to be unsuitable due to the lack of any difference in the fluorescence detected when no DNA, or only the dye, or a combination of DNA and dye were added. Three swab types (black cotton swab, Ultrafine dental applicator, and Cylinder dental applicator) were found to be much more effective for collection of DNA. Further, stained cellular material retained its fluorescence for up to 4 weeks and swabs containing cellular material that had been stored for four weeks could be stained and visualised. Additionally, DD did not affect DNA profiling. This screening method has the potential to be a routine step in a forensic laboratory to save costs of processing samples where swabs are devoid of any DNA. This technique is rapid, easy, cheap, nondestructive and safe.',

        title: 'DNA transfer in forensic science: A review',
        abstract: 'Understanding the variables impacting DNA transfer, persistence, prevalence and recovery (DNA-TPPR) has become increasingly relevant in investigations of criminal activities to provide opinion on how the DNA of a person of interest became present within the sample collected. This review considers our current knowledge regarding DNA-TPPR to assist casework investigations of criminal activities. There is a growing amount of information available on DNA-TPPR to inform the relative probabilities of the evidence given alternative scenarios relating to the presence or absence of DNA from a specific person in a collected sample of interest. This information should be used where relevant. However, far more research is still required to better understand the variables impacting DNA-TPPR and to generate more accurate probability estimates of generating particular types of profiles in more casework relevant situations. This review explores means of achieving this. It also notes the need for all those interacting with an item of interest to have an awareness of DNA transfer possibilities post criminal activity, to limit the risk of contamination or loss of DNA. Appropriately trained forensic practitioners are best placed to provide opinion and guidance on the interpretation of profiles at the activity level. However, those requested to provide expert opinion on DNA-related activity level issues are often insufficiently trained to do so. We advocate recognition of DNA activity associated expertise to be distinct from expertise associated with the identification of individuals. This is to be supported by dedicated training, competency testing, authorisation, and regular fit for purpose proficiency testing. The possibilities for experts to report on activity-related issues will increase as our knowledge increases through further research, access to relevant data is enhanced, and tools to assist interpretations are better exploited. Improvement opportunities will be achieved sooner, if more laboratories and agencies accept the need to invest in these aspects as well as the training of practitioners.',

        title: 'Detection of offender DNA following skin-to-skin contact with a victim',
        abstract: 'Forensic medical examiners are frequently asked to examine persons who claim to have been assaulted. If the suspect is unknown and there has been contact between his or her skin and the alleged victim, there is an expectation that DNA can be collected from the victim’s skin. In this way, the retrieved suspect DNA from the skin of the victim can be used to support the proposition that places the suspect at the scene. This study investigated the transfer and persistence of offender DNA on a victim following a mock physical assault and further transfer of the offender DNA onto clothing worn over the assaulted area. Mock assault scenarios were conducted with the offender using medium pressure without friction and heavy pressure with friction on the wrist and upper arm of the victim. Samples were taken at either 0 h, 3 h or 24 h post assault, with 18 assault scenarios conducted at each time point. Samples from the victim’s skin where the assault had taken place and, where applicable, clothing worn over the assaulted area were collected using the double swabbing method. Offender DNA was observed on the victim’s skin at 0 h in the majority of samples with a higher transfer rate observed where heavy pressure and friction was used. The presence of the offender profile was detected in the samples collected at 3 h and 24 h, with 25% and 12% of samples respectively producing a LR in support of Hp. Transfer of offender DNA to clothing worn over the assaulted area was demonstrated, with 19% of samples producing a LR in support of Hp. Samples taken from clothing were complex mixtures, with 23% of samples producing four or more person mixtures. Indirect transfer of other DNA was also observed, with background DNA on the offender’s skin observed in the clothing swabs of the victim on a number of occasions. Our data suggests that sampling from clothing worn over the assaulted area may be an additional or better avenue for the recovery of offender DNA post assault where there has been significant time between assault and sampling.',

        title: 'Detection of latent DNA',
        abstract: 'Touch DNA is one of the most common sample types submitted for DNA profiling. There is currently no process to visualise the presence of such DNA deposited when a person makes direct contact with items of forensic relevance. This report demonstrates the effective use of Diamond Dye to bind to DNA and allow visualisation of deposited cellular material using a mini-fluorescence microscope. Volunteers made contact with a range of items typical of those submitted as part of a forensic investigation. Contact was for less than 5 s and occurred either 15 min after hands were washed to remove any traces of DNA, and therefore under controlled conditions, or at an undefined time post handwashing to mimic real-world scenarios. Diamond Dye bound to cellular material on all the items used and in all cases it was clear where the volunteers had made this brief contact. It was also clear where no contact had been made. DNA profiling was performed on a sub-set of samples to confirm that the cellular material viewed under the microscope was human in origin and deposited by the person contacting the item; this was the result obtained in every sample tested. Diamond dye is relatively inexpensive, simple to apply, binds to the DNA in 3 s or less, has no mutagenic effects at the concentrations used, does not affect subsequent DNA profiling, and does not bind effectively to bacterial DNA. In combination with a mini-fluorescence microscope, this proof-of-concept study shows that otherwise invisible DNA deposited by touch can be visualised. The position and amount of cellular material deposited during even brief contact can be recorded allowing targeted sampling in any further DNA typing of forensically-significant items.',

        title: 'DNA profiles generated from a range of touched sample types',
        abstract: 'Direct PCR from touch DNA has a range of potential applications in the field of forensic investigation for exhibit examination that, under standard extraction methods, rarely produce informative DNA profiles. Previous studies from ‘touch DNA’ have focussed on fingermarks created under laboratory conditions. Here we report on successful STR DNA profiling from a range of touched items. Direct PCR, with no increase in cycle number, was performed after eight different sample types, typical of those submitted for forensic investigation, were handled by volunteers for a maximum of 15 s to deposit trace amounts of their DNA. Amplifications were performed using either GlobalFiler® or Identifiler® Plus following manufacturer’s instructions. These two kits were chosen deliberately as many laboratories worldwide have adopted and validated them in their workflow, thus allowing for direct PCR to be incorporated within their practises easily. It was found that informative STR profiles were obtained from all eight substrates using both STR kits. Identifiler® Plus out-performed GlobalFiler® in terms of the percentage of alleles amplified using the direct PCR approach. Both generated informative profiles from all items and all individuals, at different rates, with Identifiler® Plus being informative in a larger percentage of samples. GlobalFiler® produced profiles with an average of 60% ± 24% (36 ± 15 alleles) alleles present while Identifiler® Plus produced profiles with an average of 96% ± 4% (31 ± 1 alleles) alleles present. A comparison was made between the direct PCR approach and subjecting touched samples to a standard DNA extraction process, both using Identifiler®. An average of 4% of profiles were informative for samples that underwent extraction with 100% being informative from the same subset of samples amplified by direct PCR. Our findings further demonstrate the success of direct PCR to enhance the STR DNA profiles from touch DNA. Further, Identifiler® Plus was found to generate informative profiles more often than GlobalFiler®. Direct PCR is fast, simple, and non-destructive of evidence with the ability to generate informative genetic data where standard methods are likely to fail.',

        abstract: 'More often than not, the source of DNA traces found at a crime scene is not disputed, but the activity or timing of events that resulted in their transfer is. As a consequence, practitioners are increasingly asked to assign a value to DNA evidence given propositions about activities provided by prosecution and defense counsel. Given that the dispute concerns the nature of the activity that took place or the identity of the actor that carried out the activity, several factors will determine how to formulate the propositions. Determining factors are (1) whether defense claims the crime never took place, (2) whether defense claims someone other than the accused (either an unknown individual or a known person) performed the criminal activity, and (3) whether it is claimed and disputed that the suspect performed an alternative, legitimate activity or has a relation to the victim, the object, or the scene of crime that implies a legitimate interaction. Addressing such propositions using Bayesian networks, we demonstrate the effects of the various proposition sets on the evaluation of the evidence.',
